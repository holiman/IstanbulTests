### Tests

This repo contains `StateTest`s generated by geth, for the upcoming Istanbul hardfork. They are not meant to 'compete with' or differ from 
the main testcases maintained in the ethereum/tests repository, but rather complement them and eventually make it in there aswell. 

These tests contain a quirk, in that they contain `fork` names such as `ConstantinopleFix+1884`, which is not yet implemented
across all clients. 

In this repo, all tests contain three separate artefacts:

1. The test itself (e.g. `stateTest-selfbalance.json`)
2. The state dump(s), i.e the dump of all accounts in the state after executing the test(s). (e.g. `stateDump-selfbalance.json`)
3. The state trace(s), i.e the execution traces from all the tests. (e.g. `stateTraces-selfbalance.json`).
